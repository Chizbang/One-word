One word
========

On this project you start a session, give a link of the session to a friend, at which point you say one word and your friend has to say another word relating to the word you just said to form a sentance.
 

**TO DO**

1. Implement a messages per interval limit

2. Add a time out for empty sessions.

Please also note that the design is subject to change.
