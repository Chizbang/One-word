I have been writing this project on and off for 2 weeks so far. Due to some complications I havent been able to spend much time on it. So far, its mostly functional and usable as a chat room chat service. 

**TO DO**

1. Make sure the host cannot join as a player to a session

2. Update the design (the design is NOT final)

3. Float the hosts messages to the left and the players messages to the right for clarity

4. Implement a messages per interval limit

5. Make the chat window scroll as the chat expands

6. Add a time out for empty sessions.

7. Stop all session page timers on page leave
