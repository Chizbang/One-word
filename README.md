One word
========
I have been writing this project on and off for 2 weeks so far. Due to some complications I havent been able to spend much time on it. So far, its mostly functional and usable as a chat room chat service. 

**TO DO**

1. Implement a messages per interval limit

2. Add a time out for empty sessions.

Please also note that the design is subject to change.
