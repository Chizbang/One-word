One word
========
I have been writing this project on and off for 2 weeks so far. Due to some complications I havent been able to spend much time on it. So far, its mostly functional and usable as a chat room chat service. 

**TO DO**

1. Explode messages so that theres only one word per message

2. Make sure the host cannot join as a player to a session

3. Update the design (the design is NOT final)

4. Float the hosts messages to the left and the players messages to the right for clarity

5. Sanitize forms

6. Implement a messages per interval limit

7. Make the chat window scroll as the chat expands

8. Add a time out for empty sessions.

9. Stop all session page timers on page leave
